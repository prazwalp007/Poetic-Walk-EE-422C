Poetic Walk implements a common Natural Language Processing technique called N-gram.
The program takes a poem as an input and will use the corpus to generate a word affinity graph.
From there the poetic graph program will take another dry(boring)-business-speak-input and use the graph to generate poem by inserting bridge word between each pair of input words.
